Given a question and an answer, analyze the complexity of each sentence in the answer. Break down each sentence into one or more fully understandable statements. Ensure that no pronouns are used in any statement. Format the outputs in JSON.

Example Input: 
Question: Who was Albert Einstein and what is he best known for?
Answer: He was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. He was best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.

Example Output:
["Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist.", "Albert Einstein is recognized as one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.","Albert Einstein was best known for developing the theory of relativity.","Albert Einstein also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics."]

Given a ground truth and an answer statements, analyze each statement and classify them in one of the following categories: TP (true positive): statements that are present in answer that are also directly supported by the one or more statements in ground truth, FP (false positive): statements present in the answer but not directly supported by any statement in ground truth, FN (false negative): statements found in the ground truth but not present in answer. Each statement can only belong to one of the categories. Provide a reason for each classification.
